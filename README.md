# Task requirements
Develop a React application for displaying a table with data fetched from the PokeAPI.
# Features:
- Implement columns sorting functionality.
-  Add pagination to display a limited number of entries per page.
- Click on a table row should display additional information about the selected entity.
- Display a loader while the data is being fetched (randomly simulate a delay if it is needed).

# Technologies:

-  TypeScript
-  Use Material UI components for clean and responsive design.
